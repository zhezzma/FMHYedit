Happy holidays everyone, I hope you are all doing well.

I would just like to take a moment to talk about something very important to me. My hope is it will provide some clarity as to our motivations behind this project, and spread a bit of love to you all.

***

The concept I'd like to discuss has many names. Some call it oneness, interconnectedness, selflessness etc. The name you choose doesn't really matter, but I think the ideas behind these concepts are important, and worth thinking about. I would say these concepts are my main motivation for FMHY, and I hope some of you find the same inspiration, and comfort from them as I do.

To put things simply, the idea is that we are all more connected to one another, and our world, than it may seem. In order to show this, we need look no further than consciousness itself. The late great Alan Watts put it this way: *"The external world is as much you as your own body. Your skin doesn‚Äôt separate you from the world. It‚Äôs a bridge through which the external world flows into you, and you flow into it."*

In other words, the ability to experience the things outside of ourselves, and the ability to experience ourselves **are one**. Everyone and everything is all a part of the same ocean, so to speak. David Mitchell once said: *"My life amounts to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean. Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?‚Äù* 

People always ask how they can give back to this project, and my answer is very simple. **Direct that love to places in our world where it normally doesn't exist**, even if you don't benefit directly. Help those in need where you can. Treat the misery and misfortune of others as your own. Treat our world, and the people in it, as if they were you. That is all I ask, and will ever ask.

* *"I want you to see the beauty of giving love where it isn't merited. Any man can give love where he's sure it's returned. That isn't love at all. But to give love with no thought of merit, no thought of return, no thought of gratitude even. That's ordinarily the privilege of God."* - Edward Paramore

* *"Basically, everything is one. There is no way in which you draw a line between things. What we do is make these subdivisions, but they‚Äôre not real. I think maybe poets ‚Ä¶ have some understanding of this."* - Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize-Winning physiologist

* *"The wise man beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings; for that reason, he does not hate anyone."* - Isa Upanishad

* *"I honor the place in you where the entire Universe resides. I honor the place in you of love, of light, of peace and of truth. I honor the place in you, that is the same in me. There is but one."* - Namaste, ‚ÄãAncient Sanskrit

**TLDR** - I love you guys. I hope this project has had a positive affect on your lives.
